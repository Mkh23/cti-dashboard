# Implementation Notes - Role-Based Dashboard Backend

## Summary

Successfully implemented role-based dashboard backend features with comprehensive testing, achieving **92.93% test coverage** (significantly exceeding the 80% target).

## Completed Work

### 1. S3 Presigned URL Generation (`api/app/s3_utils.py`)

**Purpose**: Provide secure, time-limited access to assets stored in S3 without exposing AWS credentials.

**Features**:
- Generate presigned URLs for S3 objects
- Configurable expiration times (default: 1 hour)
- Graceful error handling for missing credentials or invalid buckets
- Support for AWS profiles and environment configuration

**Test Coverage**: 100% (6 tests)

### 2. Enhanced Scans API (`api/app/routers/scans.py`)

**New Endpoints**:

#### `GET /scans/stats`
- Returns total scan count
- Breakdown by status (uploaded, ingested, graded, error)
- Count of recent scans (last 24 hours)
- Role-aware filtering (foundation for farm-based restrictions)

#### Updated `GET /scans/{scan_id}`
- Now includes presigned URLs for image and mask assets
- Automatically generates secure URLs with 1-hour expiration
- Includes device and farm information when available

**Features**:
- Role-based access control helpers (`get_user_roles`, `is_admin`)
- Pagination support for scan listing
- Status, device, and farm filtering
- Sorting by created_at or captured_at

**Test Coverage**: 95% (19 tests)

### 3. Comprehensive Test Suite

**Total**: 61 tests passing with 92.93% coverage

#### Test Breakdown:
- **Auth Module**: 12 tests, 100% coverage
- **Admin Endpoints**: 16 tests, 83% coverage
- **Scans Management**: 19 tests, 95% coverage
- **Webhooks**: 6 tests, 89% coverage
- **S3 Utilities**: 6 tests, 100% coverage
- **Health Checks**: 2 tests, 100% coverage

#### Key Test Additions:
1. S3 presigned URL generation tests (success, errors, credentials)
2. Scan listing with filters and pagination
3. Scan detail with presigned URLs
4. Scan statistics endpoint
5. Role-based access control tests
6. Asset linking tests (image, mask)
7. Status transition tests
8. Farm linking tests

### 4. Documentation Updates

Updated three key documentation files:

#### README.md
- Added new API endpoints with categorization
- Updated test coverage statistics
- Added S3 features to project status
- Improved endpoint documentation

#### TESTING.md
- Updated coverage report (92.93%)
- Added new test descriptions for scans and S3 utilities
- Updated test count and statistics
- Marked completed test additions

#### ROADMAP.md
- Updated high-level objectives
- Marked scan API features as complete
- Updated testing strategy section
- Updated Phase C completion status

### 5. Bug Fixes and Improvements

1. **Fixed ScanStatus Enum Usage**
   - Changed all `pending` references to valid enum values
   - Updated status transition tests to use correct values
   - Fixed test expectations to match actual enum

2. **Fixed Webhook Idempotency Test**
   - Corrected capture_id pattern to match schema validation
   - Fixed HMAC signature generation for duplicate requests
   - Added proper time delays for timestamp uniqueness

3. **Improved Test Fixtures**
   - Made device codes unique to avoid conflicts
   - Fixed test data to use valid ScanStatus values
   - Improved test isolation

4. **Added Dependencies**
   - Added boto3==1.35.0 to requirements.txt for S3 operations

## Technical Decisions

### 1. S3 Presigned URLs
- **Why**: Provides secure, time-limited access without exposing credentials
- **Implementation**: Separate utility module for reusability
- **Expiration**: Default 1 hour, configurable per request
- **Error Handling**: Returns None on failure, allowing graceful degradation

### 2. Role-Based Access
- **Foundation**: Helper functions for role checking
- **Current**: Admin sees all scans
- **Future**: Can extend to farm-based filtering for technicians and farmers
- **Scalability**: Designed to support user-farm relationships

### 3. Statistics Endpoint
- **Purpose**: Provide dashboard overview metrics
- **Metrics**: Total, by status, recent activity
- **Performance**: Single query with aggregation
- **Extension**: Ready for time-based trends

### 4. Test Strategy
- **Philosophy**: Test what matters for production
- **Coverage Target**: 80%+ (achieved 92.93%)
- **Focus**: Integration tests for critical paths
- **Isolation**: Each test gets fresh database state

## API Endpoints Added/Updated

### New Endpoints
```
GET /scans/stats - Scan statistics with role-based filtering
```

### Enhanced Endpoints
```
GET /scans/{scan_id} - Now includes presigned URLs for assets
```

### Response Examples

#### GET /scans/stats
```json
{
  "total": 150,
  "by_status": {
    "uploaded": 45,
    "ingested": 80,
    "graded": 20,
    "error": 5
  },
  "recent_count": 12
}
```

#### GET /scans/{scan_id}
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "capture_id": "cap_1234567890",
  "device_code": "DEV-001",
  "device_label": "Field Device 1",
  "farm_name": "Green Valley Farm",
  "status": "ingested",
  "image_url": "https://bucket.s3.region.amazonaws.com/path?X-Amz-...",
  "mask_url": "https://bucket.s3.region.amazonaws.com/path?X-Amz-...",
  ...
}
```

## Future Enhancements

### Recommended Next Steps:
1. **User-Farm Relationships**: Add UserFarm model for fine-grained access
2. **Farm-Based Filtering**: Filter scans by user's assigned farms
3. **Signed URL Caching**: Cache presigned URLs to reduce S3 API calls
4. **Statistics Dashboard**: Frontend component using /scans/stats endpoint
5. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket support for live scan status updates

### AWS Integration:
- EventBridge rule for S3 events
- Lambda function with HMAC signing
- SQS DLQ for failed ingestions
- Replay endpoint for DLQ processing

## Performance Considerations

- **Presigned URLs**: Generated on-demand, consider caching for frequently accessed assets
- **Statistics Query**: Single aggregation query, but could benefit from materialized view for large datasets
- **Pagination**: Implemented efficiently with offset/limit
- **Role Checks**: Simple query, but could benefit from caching user roles

## Security Notes

- All endpoints require authentication (JWT tokens)
- Presigned URLs expire after 1 hour (configurable)
- Role-based access foundation in place
- HMAC validation for webhook security
- No AWS credentials exposed to clients

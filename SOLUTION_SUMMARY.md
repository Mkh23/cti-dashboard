# Solution Summary: Fix users.updated_at Column Issue

## Problem
When trying to register a user, the application raised an error:
```
psycopg2.errors.UndefinedColumn: column users.updated_at does not exist
```

## Root Cause
The database was created using an older method (likely `Base.metadata.create_all()`) before Alembic migrations were properly set up. The SQLAlchemy model defines an `updated_at` column, but the actual database table didn't have this column because it was created before the migration system was implemented.

## Solution
The Alembic migration file (`api/alembic/versions/9f92e181eda7_initial_baseline_with_all_tables.py`) **already includes** the `updated_at` column (line 76). The solution is to ensure users run migrations properly to create/update the database schema.

### For Fresh Database
```bash
cd /home/runner/work/cti-dashboard/cti-dashboard
docker compose up -d db
cd api
alembic upgrade head
```

### For Existing Database with Data
If you have existing data you want to preserve:
```bash
docker compose exec db psql -U postgres -d cti -c "ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW();"
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Documentation Updates
- **api/README.md**: Added comprehensive troubleshooting section explaining the error and solutions
- **README.md**: Added clear warning about running migrations before starting the API
- **ROADMAP.md**: Updated to reflect completion of database schema issues
- **TESTING.md**: Added troubleshooting section for the missing column error

### 2. Test Improvements
- **api/tests/conftest.py**: Fixed to handle existing roles in test database gracefully
- **api/tests/test_auth.py**: Enhanced `test_password_is_hashed` to also verify timestamp columns exist

## Verification

### Test Coverage
- All 14 tests passing ✅
- 71% code coverage (exceeds 70% requirement) ✅
- All auth endpoints fully tested (100% coverage)

### Manual Testing
```bash
# 1. Registration works
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "password": "Pass123!"}'
# Response: {"id":"...","email":"test@example.com"}

# 2. Users have timestamps
psql -c "SELECT email, created_at, updated_at FROM users;"
# Both columns present and populated ✅
```

### Database Schema Verification
```sql
\d users
-- Column      | Type                        
-- -----------+-----------------------------
-- created_at | timestamp without time zone
-- updated_at | timestamp without time zone
```

## Key Takeaways
1. Always run `alembic upgrade head` after pulling code changes
2. The migration file is correct - no changes needed to the schema
3. The issue only affects databases created before migrations were set up
4. Comprehensive documentation added to prevent future occurrences

## Files Modified
- `README.md` - Added migration instructions
- `api/README.md` - Added troubleshooting section
- `ROADMAP.md` - Updated completion status
- `TESTING.md` - Added troubleshooting for missing columns
- `api/tests/conftest.py` - Fixed role seeding logic
- `api/tests/test_auth.py` - Enhanced timestamp validation
